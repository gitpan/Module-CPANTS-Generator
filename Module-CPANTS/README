NAME
    Module::CPANTS - CPAN Module Testing

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::CPANTS;
      my $c = Module::CPANTS;
      my $cpants = $c->data;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an initial stab at providing automated testing for the modules
    on CPAN. Alpha release and all that. It's just out there to test the
    waters.

    CPANTS was initially described by Michael Schwern a long time ago in:
    http://archive.develooper.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg00148.html It is
    highly recommended that you read that.

    The idea is to have automated module testing reporting back all sorts of
    metadata about the modules on CPAN.

    The current interface is a large hash. The keys in the hash are
    distributions. For example, the information available for
    Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz is accessible using:

      my $dist = 'Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz';
      my $data = $cpants->{$dist};

    The actual information currently returned is as follows:

      'Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz' => {
        'author' => 'LBROCARD',
        'description' => 'additive and subtractive human-readable colours',
        'files' => [
          'Makefile.PL',
          'README',
          'MANIFEST'
        ],
        'lines' => {
          'nonpod' => 170,
          'pod' => 95,
          'total' => 265,
          'with_comments' => 8
        },
        'requires' => [
          'Graphics-ColorNames-0.32.tar.gz',
          'Scalar-List-Utils-1.11.tar.gz',
          'Test-Simple-0.47.tar.gz'
        ],
        'requires_module' => {
          'Graphics::ColorNames' => 0,
          'List::Util' => 0,
          'Test::Simple' => 0
        },
        'requires_recursive' => [
          'File-Spec-0.82.tar.gz',
          'Graphics-ColorNames-0.32.tar.gz',
          'Scalar-List-Utils-1.11.tar.gz',
          'Test-Harness-2.26.tar.gz',
          'Test-Simple-0.47.tar.gz'
        ],
        'testers' => {
          'fail' => 1,
          'pass' => 5,
        },
      }

    The "author" field is the PAUSE ID of the author of the distribution.

    The "description" field is the description listed in the CPAN modules
    list for the distribibution.

    The "lines" field shows the number of pod lines (documentation), non-pod
    lines (code), lines with comments, and total lines in all the modules in
    a distribution.

    The "files" field is a listref containing interesting files which were
    found. The following files are deemed interesting at the moment:
    Makefile.PL, README, Build.PL, META.yml, SIGNATURE, MANIFEST.

    The "requires_module" field is a hashref containing the module
    prerequisites listed in the Makefile.PL for the distribution.

    The "requires" field is a listref containing all the distributions
    containing the module prerequisite listed in the Makefile.PL for the
    distribution.

    The "requires_recursive" is the same as "requires" but lists the
    recursive dependencies. This should be all the distributions that the
    distribution needs to run.

    The "testers" field contains the number of passes and fails reported by
    the CPAN testers (http://testers.cpan.org/).

    More data is to be added soon. A metric may be added soon.

    Note that CPANPLUS is very useful for relating modules to distributions.
