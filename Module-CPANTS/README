NAME
    Module::CPANTS - CPAN Module Testing

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::CPANTS;
      my $c = Module::CPANTS->new();
      my $cpants = $c->data;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an initial stab at providing automated testing metrics for the
    modules on CPAN. Alpha release and all that. It's just out there to test
    the waters.

    CPANTS was initially described by Michael Schwern a long time ago in:
    http://archive.develooper.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg00148.html It is
    highly recommended that you read that.

    The idea is to have automated module testing reporting back all sorts of
    metadata about the modules on CPAN.

    The current interface is a large hash. The keys in the hash are
    distributions. For example, the information available for
    Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz is accessible using:

      my $dist = 'Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz';
      my $data = $cpants->{$dist};

    The actual information currently returned is as follows:

      'Acme-Colour-0.20.tar.gz' => {
        'author' => 'LBROCARD',
        'description' => 'additive and subtractive human-readable colours',
        'files' => [
          'Makefile.PL',
          'README',
          'MANIFEST'
        ],
        'lines' => {
          'nonpod' => 170,
          'pod' => 95,
          'pod_errors' => 0,
          'total' => 265,
          'with_comments' => 8,
        },
        'releases' => '5',
        'requires' => [
          'Graphics-ColorNames-0.32.tar.gz',
          'Scalar-List-Utils-1.11.tar.gz',
          'Test-Simple-0.47.tar.gz'
        ],
        'requires_module' => {
          'Graphics::ColorNames' => 0,
          'List::Util' => 0,
          'Test::Simple' => 0
        },
        'requires_recursive' => [
          'File-Spec-0.82.tar.gz',
          'Graphics-ColorNames-0.32.tar.gz',
          'Scalar-List-Utils-1.11.tar.gz',
          'Test-Harness-2.28.tar.gz',
          'Test-Simple-0.47.tar.gz'
        ],
        'size' => {
          'packed' => 3883,
          'unpacked' => 13078
        },
        'testers' => {
          'fail' => 1,
          'pass' => 5
        },
        'uses' => [
          'Graphics::ColorNames',
          'List::Util',
          'strict',
          'vars'
        ]
      }

    The "author" field is the PAUSE ID of the author of the distribution.

    The "description" field is the description listed in the CPAN modules
    list for the distribibution.

    The "lines" field shows the number of POD lines (documentation), number
    of POD errors reported by Pod::Simple::Checker, non-POD lines (code),
    lines with comments, and total lines in all the modules in a
    distribution.

    The "files" field is a listref containing interesting files which were
    found. The following files are deemed interesting at the moment:
    Makefile.PL, README, Build.PL, META.yml, SIGNATURE, MANIFEST.

    The "releases" field contains the total number of releases to CPAN that
    distribution has.

    The "requires_module" field is a hashref containing the module
    prerequisites listed in the Makefile.PL for the distribution.

    The "requires" field is a listref containing all the distributions
    containing the module prerequisite listed in the Makefile.PL for the
    distribution.

    The "requires_recursive" is the same as "requires" but lists the
    recursive dependencies. This should be all the distributions that the
    distribution needs to run.

    The "size" contains two fields: the packed and unpacked size of the
    distribution in bytes.

    The "testers" field contains the number of passes and fails reported by
    the CPAN testers (http://testers.cpan.org/). The "tests" subfield
    returns the number of tests in that distribution (this is only available
    for a limited number of distributions at the moment).

    More data is to be added soon. A kwalitee rating may be added soon.

    Note that CPANPLUS is very useful for relating modules to distributions.
