NAME
    Module::CPANTS::Generator - CPAN Testing Service and Kwalitee Calculator

DESCRIPTION
    This module is part of the beta CPANTS project. It consists of many
    modules that unpack CPAN, gather meta information about it and create
    the Module::CPANTS distribution. You only need this if you want to add
    more metrics to Module::CPANTS.

    Please note that CPAN::DistnameInfo Version 0.04 is needed, which is not
    released yet. You can get it from here:
    http://svn.mutatus.co.uk/browse/CPAN-DistnameInfo/trunk/
