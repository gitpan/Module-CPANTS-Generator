NAME
    Module::CPANTS::Generator

DESCRIPTION
    This module is part of the beta CPANTS project. It consists of many
    modules that unpack CPAN, gather meta information about it and create
    the Module::CPANTS distribution. You only need this if you want to add
    more metrics to Module::CPANTS.
